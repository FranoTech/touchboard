Mouse Control using Computer Vision: In this project we identify a marker of hand/finger using a simple webcam and openCV libraries. With the help of suitable image processing steps the co-ordinates of marker head or finger tip are passed to the mouse pointer and the cursor is controlled. only left click is enabled till now. We are working on the other mouse functionalities and the touch senstivity.
